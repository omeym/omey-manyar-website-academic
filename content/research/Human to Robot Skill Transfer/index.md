title: Human to Robot Skill Transfer
summary: Humans perform several dynamic tasks with ease by learning a high level decision making policy. Whenever a new scenario is encountered decisions are made based on this policy rather than complete re-learning. This work focuses on empowering robots with a similar decision making skill by learning a policy to perform highly dynamical tasks.
