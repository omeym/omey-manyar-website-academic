Compliant or deformable objects are challenging to manipulate due to their inherent physical properties. Majority of the objects that we interact with in our daily lives have some level of deformability associated with them. Thus, it becomes important for robots to successfully manipulate and generate feasible motion plans to accomplish tasks involving deformable/complaint objects.
