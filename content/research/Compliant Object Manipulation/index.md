summary: Compliant or deformable objects are challenging to manipulate due to their inherent physical properties. However, the majority of the objects humans interact with are deformable. This work focuses on enabling robots to handle such objects with greater efficiency and flexibility and to be able to adapt to changes in the objects or their surroundings.

Compliant or deformable objects are challenging to manipulate due to their inherent physical properties. Majority of the objects that we interact with in our daily lives have some level of deformability associated with them. Thus, it becomes important for robots to successfully manipulate and generate feasible motion plans to accomplish tasks involving deformable/complaint objects. We demonstrate our work on real-world robotics tasks such as composite sheet layup task and handling of compliant packages.
