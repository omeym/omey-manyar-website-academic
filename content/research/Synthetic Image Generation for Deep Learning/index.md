summary: Synthetic image data for segmentation tasks has proved beneficial in scenarios with data scarcity. However, most of these methods fail to capture the physics of the components involved, thus generating unrealistic image data. With the aid of physics simulators, we explore different avenues for generating physics-informed synthetic images

Synthetic Images are gaining a lot of interest in the field of image segmentation. However most of the current work focuses on generating images without any knowledge of physics ingrained in them as a constraint. This research focuses on exploring different avenues in generating physics-informed synthetic. We have already demonstrated how we can defect complex features such as wrinkles and folds in synthetic data.
