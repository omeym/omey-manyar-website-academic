title: Synthetic Image Generation for Deep Learning
summary: Synthetic Images are gaining a lot of interest in the field of image segmentation. However most of the current work focuses on generating images without any knowledge of physics ingrained in them as a constraint. This research focuses on exploring different avenues in generating close to real synthetic in the pixel as well as physics domain
