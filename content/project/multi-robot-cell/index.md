title: Multi-Robot Cell for Automated Composite Layup on a Rotating Tool
summary: Composite manufacturing is an industry that is growing rapidly. In this project, we collaborated with Advanced Technology Group at Lockheed Martin to design a multi-robot cell for sheet manipulation, draping and heating. No programming is required and an easy to use interface enables quick setup times with 30% reduction in touch time.
