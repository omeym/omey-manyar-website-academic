title: A Multi-Arm Robotic Assistant for Sheet Manipulation and Draping
summary: Sheet manipulation for highly complex tasks such as prepreg composite layup is complex and challenging. The sheets used in such processes are large in size and difficult to manipulate using a single robot. In this project, the focus was to develop a multi-robot assistant system for aiding an operator in composite sheet layup task.
