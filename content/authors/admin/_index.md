Hi! I am a Ph.D. student in robotics at the University of Southern California. My advisor is [Dr. Satyandra K. Gupta.](https://sites.usc.edu/skgupta/) The focus of my work is on Robot Learning with the goal to enable knowledge transfer between humans and robots. My research also explores learning-based motion planning for deformable objects such as sheets. My vision is to enable a seamless transfer of skills between humans and robots. 

I have also investigated the generation of synthetic image data for semantic segmentation tasks involving deformable objects. 

Prior to starting my Ph.D., I have led multiple industry-funded projects at USC as a Master's student. In the past, I have worked for Rolls-Royce, Singapore as a Robotics Engineer for two years.
